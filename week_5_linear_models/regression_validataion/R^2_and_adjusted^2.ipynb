    "We have already gone through the several performance metrics in unit 0 contents such as Residual Sum of Squares(RSS), Mean Squared Error(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error(MAE). **But all these metrics have one common fault: a good value of these metrics**. What is a good value for RSS?. There is no definitive answer for this. Similar is the case with the other metrics stated above. This is due to the fact that these metrics are not limited to a particular range of values. So metrics like RSS, MSE, RMSE and MAE are not quite enought to evaluate the performance of a model. So there is a need for a better metric using which you can determine how good a model is performing. This is where $R^2$ comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The $R^{2}$ value is used to determine how differences in one variable can be explained by differences in a second variable. For instance, a person's height can be useful for explaining their weight. It is used to determine how strong of a linear relationship exists and is always in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. Note that the $R^{2}$ value is not an error measure; larger $R^{2}$ values are generally better.\n",

    "Suppose we have $n$ observed values for the output variable, $\\mathbf{y}$ as ($y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n$). And the predicted values for these observed values are, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ as ($\\hat{y_1}, \\hat{y_2}, \\dots, \\hat{y_n}$). There is an error or residual which is denoted by $\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$ as ($\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\dots, \\epsilon_n$).\n",

Similarly, $SS_{tot}$ is the total sum of squares or the variance which measures the squared distance between the actual values and their average. This is equivalent to the sum of squared residual of a model that always predicts the average.\n",

    "Here are the adjusted $R^2$ for each of the input sets. For simple linear regression, _TV_ as input has the highest adjusted $R^2$, so it is to be chosen if we want simple linear regression. Similarly, we see that with the inputs as _TV_ and _radio_, the adjusted $R^2$ increases to high value. Increasing one independent variable has increased adjusted $R^2$ too, so this feature adds a lot to fit the data points. Similarly, when we increase another independent input variable, _newspaper_, the adjusted $R^2$ decreases by a little. Unlike $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$ compensates for the addition of variables and only increases if the new predictor enhances the model above what would be obtained by probability. Hence, if we have to select the best model, then it would be the one with inputs as _TV_ and _radio_, which has the highest adjusted $R^2$."
