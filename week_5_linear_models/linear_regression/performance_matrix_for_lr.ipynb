    "It is common to build several different linear regression models using different features when attempting to predict a response. In the case of a single feature, it is sometimes possible to look at the models and determine which is better. However, in many situations, it is not possible to visually determine which model is best, especially in the case of multiple linear regression. To select the best model, we need to evaluate our models and select the one with the least amount of error when predicting the output.\n",
