    "# Ridge Regularisation\n",
    "Regularization in machine learning is a technique used to prevent overfitting, where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data. It helps models generalize better by adding a penalty to the loss function, which encourages simpler models with smaller coefficients.\n"

    "It is a technique that penalizes the polynomial model that uses a higher degree of *n* and prevents the risk of overfitting. There are three methods to perform the regularisation task. They are as follows:\n",
    "1. Ridge Regression\n",
    "2. Lasso Regression\n",
    "3. Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through each of them one by one. But first, lets understand the need of regularisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes your dataset consists of noise (outliers, irrelevant data points) and your model tries to capture it, making the model overfit. The more your model is overfit, the more difficult it is to generalize over unseen data. So, it is important to fit a model that minimizes your loss function, neither too close to zero (the case of overfitting) nor too far from zero (the case of underfitting). Thats where regularisation comes in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know OLS method finds the unbiased parameter estimates that best fits the data. It means that OLS treats every independent variables equally i.e it doesn't consider which independent variable is more important than other variables and it just finds the best fit parameters of these variables. So, there is always one set of ${\\boldsymbol\\beta}$ estimates which results in lowest Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). But the question arises, will those estimates always result in the best model? The answer is No, because there may be a possibility of the model overfitting the data or generalizing poorly to unseen data. To solve this problem, we apply Ridge Regression.\n",

    "## Mathematical Formulation of Ridge Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "As we recalled from OLS, the objective of OLS is to find a column matrix or a column vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, such that _Sum of Squared Errors_, $\\text{SSE}$ is minimum. Likewise, the objective of Ridge Regression is to find a column matrix or column vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, that minimized the sum of _Residual Sum of Squares_ ($\\text{RSS}$) and penalty equivalent to sum of squared coefficients, which is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Cost}_{Ridge}=\\text{RSS} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\boldsymbol{\\beta_j^2}= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-\\hat{y_i})^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\boldsymbol{\\beta_j^2}= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\epsilon_i^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{d}\\boldsymbol{\\beta_j^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${\\lambda}$(lambda) is a tuning parameter that along with the summation of the square of coefficient, ${\\boldsymbol\\beta}$, form the second term of the equation called shrinkage penalty. Remember that we will not be including bias or $\\beta_0$ in penalty term because the model might assign high value to bias in order to compensate the cost. When the parameters ${\\boldsymbol\\beta_1},...,{\\boldsymbol\\beta_d}$ are close to zero, the shrinkage penalty is small. The tuning parameter ${\\lambda}$ controls the contribution of RSS and summation of square of coefficent on the parameter estimates. It can be any value from 0 to $\\infty$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When ${\\lambda}$ = 0, the penalty term has is removed from the equation (i.e., the model is not penalized at all)  and the ridge regression acts like OLS by generating the least square estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "When ${\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty}$, the shrinkage penalty grows and the parameter estimates will approach zero. The model is highly penalized. It results in a simple model which poses the risk of underfitting your data i.e., the model won't learn the data enough to make good prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, finding the optimal value of ${\\lambda}$ is the goal which is discussed at the end. The ideal value of lambda produces a model that generalizes well to the unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the parameters are estimates, we usually put _hats_ on them so, the normal equation or the closed form equation to determine estimated parameters is:\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta_{Ridge}}=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} =(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}+\\lambda I)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} ......(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can recall, OLS method assumed that ${\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}}$ always exists i.e it is invertible matrix . Here, in equation (1), we can see that a small constant value ${\\lambda}$ is added to the diagonal entities of matrix ${\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}}$ before taking its inverse to form equation (2). This $\\lambda$I term is also called ridge. We are adding ridge to the diagonal and basically producing an invertible matrix, ${\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}+\\lambda I}$ even if the ${\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}}$ is singular. This is also one of the reasons Ridge Regression is preferred over OLS. Due to the addition of ridge in the diagonal term, ridge regression is called 'ridge'.\n"

The concept of $L_2$ norm is used in its geometrical visualization in forming the $L_2$ norm circle as shown in the figure below.

    "Similarly, the term $(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ is the OLS solution that generates an ellipse. The centre of the ellipse denotes the point in which the least square error(RSS) is minimum. The ellipse contour plot represents the residual sum of squares (RSS) increasing from inner ellipse to the outer ellipse quadratically. Likewise, the regularization curve is a circle which increases quadratically from origin towards the circumference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this optimization problem is to find the point where the cost function is minimum. When $\\lambda=0$, the $L_2$ norm circle passes through the OLS estimate point where $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ gives the least RSS value. But, the parameter chosen by OLS is prone to overfitting. So, we need to find that combination of $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ where the penalized loss function is minimum. For a particular lambda, we try to find the minimum point that L2 intersects with OLS. This minimum point is called ridge estimate point and the $\\lambda$ at this point is the optimal value. This point is the intersection of the ellipse and the circle as shown in the figure. But a question arises, Is the value of $\\lambda$ at ridge estimate the optimal value of $\\lambda$? The answer is maybe yes, maybe no, because the circle changes with different value of $\\lambda$ and it may first intersect the ellipse at different point. Likewise, this point of intersection can fall anywhere in the circumference of the circle unlike L1 regularisation, which will be discussed in the next chapter. Here, we visualized an example with two variables so the ridge constraint is a circle. To visualize an example containing three variables, we need a three dimesional structure (i.e. a sphere) and hypersphere for more dimensions.\n",

    "Ridge Regression is unable to reduce to coefficients exactly equal to zero. So, Ridge cannot be used for feature selection process which will be discussed in next chapter. Ridge Regression is better than Lasso Regression by its ability to select groups of collinear features in a dataset containing large number of features. This capability of Ridge Regression is called \"grouping effect\".\n",

    "We implemented the gradient descent and found cost equals 12.92 for $\\lambda$=0.01, $\\alpha$=0.01 and 5000 iterations. We would get different cost for different set of $\\lambda$, $\\alpha$ and number of iterations. The optimal value for number of iterations, $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ can be found through hyper parameter tuning. We can see the effect of ridge regression on coefficient values. We can see that on using Ridge regression, the coefficients of features are reduced."
