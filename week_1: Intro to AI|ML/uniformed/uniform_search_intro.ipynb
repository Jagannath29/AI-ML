    "# Introduction to Uniform Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Uniform Search Strategies?\n",
    "Uniform search strategies are algorithms that search through a problem space without using any domain-specific knowledge or heuristics. They are also known as uninformed or blind search strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Only use information available in the problem definition\n",
    "- Don't use additional knowledge about state locations or paths\n",
    "- Systematic exploration of the search space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Uniform Search Strategies\n",
    "1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n",
    "   - Explores all nodes at present depth before moving to next level\n",
    "   - Complete and optimal for unweighted graphs\n",
    "   - Space complexity is a major concern\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**\n",
    "   - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking\n",
    "   - Memory efficient\n",
    "   - Not guaranteed to find shortest path\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Uniform-Cost Search**\n",
    "   - Explores paths based on cumulative cost\n",
    "   - Optimal for weighted graphs\n",
    "   - More computationally intensive\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of Search Strategies\n",
    "| Strategy | Complete? | Optimal? | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| BFS | Yes | Yes* | O(b^d) | O(b^d) |\n",
    "| DFS | No† | No | O(b^m) | O(bm) |\n",
    "| UCS | Yes | Yes | O(b^(C*/ε)) | O(b^(C*/ε)) |\n",
    "\n",
    "*For unweighted graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "†Complete in finite spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Uniform Search?\n",
    "1. When no additional information is available about the problem\n",
    "2. When completeness guarantee is required\n",
    "3. When optimal solution is needed (BFS/UCS)\n",
    "4. When memory constraints are tight (DFS)"
