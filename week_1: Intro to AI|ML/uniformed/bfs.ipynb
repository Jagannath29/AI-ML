    "## Theory and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level. It starts at a given source node and explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Visits nodes in order of their distance from the source\n",
    "- Uses a queue data structure (First-In-First-Out)\n",
    "- Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs\n",
    "- Complete algorithm (will find a solution if it exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(V) for the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "1. Finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs\n",
    "2. Web crawling\n",
    "3. Social networking (finding connections)\n",
    "4. GPS Navigation\n",
